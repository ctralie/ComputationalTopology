Code for manipulating simplicial complexes


This started as a side project in Math 412: Toplogy with Applications, at Duke University.  My goal was to implement some of the algorithms for computing Betti numbers and persistent homology in simplicial complexes, especially complexes that are difficult to do by hand.
